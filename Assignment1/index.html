				<header id="item1">Sushi & Sashimi</header>
				<p>Sushi is known all over the world and is unique in its creation because every piece of rice is seasoned with a rice vinegar mix  and then mixed with different ingredients such as a variety of seafood, vegetables, nori (seaweed), etc.. You can just grab a piece of sushi with chopsticks and dip it into soy sauce or wasabi, or both. It is truly a mix of flavors in your mouth! Depending on the shape and ingredients that are used, sushi can be called different names: Nigiri sushi, Maki sushi , Oshi sushi , Temaki sushi, etc</p>

				<header id="item3">Kare-Raisu</header>
				<p>Also a very popular, simple and delicious dish that we can find in Japan, Kare-Raisu is just rice with curry but the taste is certainly different from any other curry dishes I've had before. To make Japanese curry, you can use a variety of meats and vegetables. The basic vegetables are onions, carrots and sweet potatos, and the meats used are chicken, pork, beef and sometimes duck. There are different levels of spiciness for curry: soft, regular and hot are the most common.</p>
